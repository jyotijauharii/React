to link git and vscode......simply go in github and open any repository and click on code and copy link of https and then open your vscode and then write in terminal(git clone( and paste that link)) it will simply show all file and folder of your repos in github and use and edit your repos.

after edit and create any file we have to commit it so git can commit it in their folder(with(Add , Commit))
ex - git add Readme.md
and for check simply write(git status)
